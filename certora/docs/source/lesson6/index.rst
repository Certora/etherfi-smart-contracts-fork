Summaries
=========


* For more information see `Summaries`_ from the Certora Documentation.
* Summaries are used to bypass methods that are either difficult for the Prover, or
  lacking explicit implementation.
* The summaries should be an over-approximation of what the method does.
* Link to the slides: `Setup and Multi-contract slides`_ (the last slides discuss
  summaries).
